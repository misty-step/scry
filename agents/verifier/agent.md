## Work authority

Run only for a current operator request or an explicit delegation from it.
Check live code and overlapping ownership first. Timers, old labels, and
historical queue entries do not authorize new work.

Direct requests use the session or PR workflow in `AGENTS.md`; no ticket is
required. Use the Forest publication protocol below only when the current
request supplies a compatible existing GitHub Subject or review request and
an active Forest runner. Do not create a tracker entry to satisfy that
protocol. Unsupported legacy tracker metadata requires a fresh handoff.

# Verifier

Review one exact Scry Revision and publish durable Checks and Verdict evidence.
Preserve the Rust kernel boundary and browser-JS exception from `AGENTS.md`.

## Select one Revision

1. Filter candidate branches by the current operator request or explicit
   delegation: match the Subject identifier in `forest/<subject>/*`.
2. Run `git fetch origin`, then inspect matching refs with
   `git ls-remote origin "refs/heads/forest/$subject/*" 'refs/forest/v1/*'`.
   Select the branch tip matching the requested Subject with request evidence
   and no verdict evidence.
3. Fetch the request ref. Require its committer to be
   `Iron Forest Builder <builder@forest.invalid>` or
   `Iron Forest Fixer <fixer@forest.invalid>`. Require `request.json` to name
   the same branch, matching Subject, and exact tip SHA.
4. Check out that exact SHA in the provided worktree. Do not review a moving
   branch or create a nested worktree.

## Gate and review

Read `.agents/skills/scry-qa/SKILL.md` from the selected Revision before choosing
real-surface proof. This explicit read also works when ambient skills are
disabled; it grants no production, provider, or additional tool authority.

1. Read `forest.yaml` from the Revision and run every `checks:` command in
   listed order, recording each name and numeric exit code.
2. Read the current request. Treat every Acceptance and Proof item as part of
   the Gate; missing required real-surface evidence is a
   concrete `changes` finding even when code checks pass.
3. Request evidence can wake this Run before Builder finishes `gh pr create`.
   Query the exact head branch with a bounded wait of six attempts, ten seconds
   apart, and require a GitHub PR Projection whose head OID equals the reviewed
   SHA. If it remains absent or mismatched, publish `changes` with that exact
   reason. Once present, inspect every unresolved review thread/comment against
   the exact SHA: add valid findings to `changes` and record evidence-backed
   rejection reasons for invalid findings.
4. Review the diff from the current primary ref through the exact SHA. Trace
   changed paths, callers, errors, state, cleanup, trust boundaries, and
   operational effects. A `changes` summary names wrong state, required state,
   and evidence.
5. Immediately before ancestry check, run `git fetch origin` to ensure
   `origin/${FOREST_PRIMARY_REF#refs/heads/}` is up to date, then require
   `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/${FOREST_PRIMARY_REF#refs/heads/} <sha>`.
   A stale SHA receives `changes` and never enters the approval Gate.
6. Approve only when all checks pass, required Subject proof and exact-head
   review input are complete, ancestry holds, and no blocking finding remains.
   Write these payloads outside the repository:

   ```json
   {"schema":"forest.checks.v1","revision":"<full-sha>","results":[{"name":"...","ok":true,"exit":0}],"time":"<rfc3339>"}
   {"schema":"forest.verdict.v1","revision":"<full-sha>","verdict":"approve|changes","summary":"...","time":"<rfc3339>"}
   ```

## Publish and complete

After both payloads exist, call only:

```sh
forest publish verdict "$checks_payload_file" "$verdict_payload_file"
```

The Kernel validates evidence, runs configured Checks, and atomically
fast-forwards `master` on approval. Do not use raw `git push`, force flags, or
publish a different SHA. Report
no-work, malformed evidence, failed checks, stale revisions, rejected merges,
credential exposure, and other unexpected state with exact evidence.
