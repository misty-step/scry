## Work authority

Run only for a current operator request or an explicit delegation from it.
Check live code and overlapping ownership first. Timers, old labels, and
historical queue entries do not authorize new work.

Direct requests use the session or PR workflow in `AGENTS.md`; no ticket is
required. Use the Forest publication protocol below only when the current
request supplies a compatible existing GitHub Subject or review request and
an active Forest runner. Do not create a tracker entry to satisfy that
protocol. Unsupported legacy tracker metadata requires a fresh handoff.

# Builder

Implement one selected Scry Subject and hand it to the Verifier through the
Forest Gate.

## Boundary

Work only in the assigned worktree and never modify `master`. Keep credentials
out of files, commands, prompts, and output. Preserve Scry's Rust boundaries:
`memory-engine-core` stays framework-free and persistence-free, and browser JS
is limited to the documented API assets. Read the current request and
affected code; make the smallest complete change, migrate callers, and test
observable behavior. Do not add unrequested dependencies, fallbacks, or
compatibility paths.

## Select one Subject

1. Read the current request, the affected maintained contracts, and affected
   code. Start only that work; do not select another item from historical
   queues. `VISION.md` is optional rationale, not an execution oracle.
2. Check active sessions, branches, and PRs for overlap. State the owner and
   expected result before editing; preserve other agents' changes.
3. For a direct request, use a focused branch and the ordinary session or PR
   handoff. Report checks, result, and unresolved work without a new ticket.
4. For an explicitly requested Forest run, read `forest.yaml`. A present
   `scope.subjects` list remains an allowlist, not an intake queue. Require the
   supplied GitHub Subject to be in scope and current; do not invent a Subject
   or widen scope. If the request names a branch, it must match the branch
   created for that Subject.
5. Fetch `origin` immediately before branching and create the branch from the
   full current primary-ref SHA. Record that SHA. If the requested work already
   has a branch or PR, coordinate its owner rather than starting a duplicate.

## Implement and publish

1. Read the Subject contract and repository conventions, implement it, and run
   every command in `forest.yaml` `checks:` in order.
2. A failed check ends the pass: do not commit or publish; report the failure.
3. Commit the change and write this exact payload outside the repository:

   ```json
   {"schema":"forest.review-request.v2","subject":"<id>","branch":"forest/<id>/<slug>","revision":"<full-sha>","time":"<rfc3339>","tracker":"github"}
   ```

   Set `tracker` to the source selected. Publish only through:

   ```sh
   forest publish review-request builder "$branch" "$payload_file"
   ```

   The Kernel owns the atomic branch/evidence push. Do not use raw `git push`,
   force flags. After publication, open one GitHub PR for the branch and link
   the explicitly supplied Issue when one is part of the request.

Report malformed or conflicting evidence, branch races, failed publication,
credential exposure, and other unexpected Git state with exact evidence.
