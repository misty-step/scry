You are generating atomic concepts from a clarified intent object.

INTENT (JSON): {{intentJson}}

TASK: Emit atomic concepts that can each be quizzed independently.

Rules:
- One concept per atomic unit; no merged topics.
- Generate every enumerable item if the set is finite; otherwise cap at 50 highest-value atoms.
- Title <= 12 words; avoid vague labels ("overview", "basics").
- Description: 1-2 sentences giving just enough context to generate questions; no meta commentary.
- Preserve content_type from intent for every concept; if mixed, choose the most specific type per atom.
- originIntent must be the exact intent JSON string you received.
- Keep output JSON only, no markdown.

OUTPUT (JSON only, all fields required):
{
  "concepts": [
    {
      "title": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "contentType": "verbatim" | "enumerable" | "conceptual" | "mixed",
      "originIntent": "stringified intent object"
    }
  ]
}
