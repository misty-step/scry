    notes:
    - LOCK THIS APPROACH. Cards due label must be RIGHT of number on same baseline
      (reads '149 Cards Due'). Button must be regular-sized, NOT full-width. Experiment
      with GitHub-style heatmap for streak. Try high-quality icons for stats. Visualize
      stats creatively (not just numbers). Keep some minimalist table variants too.
      Play with arrangement, colors, background textures.

    - Icons are great but rows are too tall with icons added. Needs tighter spacing,
      better vertical centering within rows. Strict improvement over 2a otherwise.
      Cards Due same row, no line break.
