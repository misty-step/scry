# Scry Product Vision

Status: Canonical consumer-product vision. Scry is the product, and this repository is its Rust engine. Revise this file when that product premise, the shared capability boundary, or the proof bar materially changes.

## The Product

Scry helps a person learn and memorize anything they want to know. Its promise is **Remember everything.** The experience should feel effortless: bring a goal or source, answer a useful quiz, and let the system turn each attempt into the next best review. Quiz-driven memorization is the heart of Scry. Learning material exists to make the quiz loop better, especially when a learner misses or is close.

Scry is not a generic agent-memory store, a chat tutor, or a card database that makes the learner design scheduling policy by hand. The product earns trust by making good learning decisions visible: what to review, why an answer was graded, and what easier bridge quiz comes before a missed item returns.

## Product Loop

1. A learner brings a goal or source material, such as available study material or a short prompt.
2. Scry turns that input into atomic, reviewable quiz material and the context needed to answer it.
3. The learner starts a quiz quickly, answers, and receives clear graded feedback.
4. Scry schedules the next review from the result and adapts difficulty from the learner's evidence.
5. A wrong, close, or revealed attempt produces easier bridge quiz items for prerequisite or atomic concepts before the failed item returns.

The near-term bet is a strong quiz loop, not full course generation. More learning material, richer question types, AI-graded free response, and broader remediation can follow evidence from that loop. Anki import is a later roadmap item, not a near-term requirement or the differentiator.

## Five Faces, One Capability System

Scry's capability boundary serves five faces:

- **PWA** — the primary human surface, designed for a fast phone-first study flow.
- **CLI** — a direct operator and power-user interface.
- **Skill** — a product-facing agent workflow over the same capabilities.
- **MCP** — a typed tool surface for agents and applications.
- **API** — the service boundary for the PWA and other clients.

The faces must agree on the same identifiers, quiz semantics, grading verdicts, scheduling behavior, and lifecycle states. The PWA is primary; the other faces are not separate products with separate learning rules.

## Access and Business Model

Beta access is invite-gated. The entry path makes the waitlist visible instead of pretending that public access is open. Human sign-in uses magic links only; Scry does not add OAuth as a hidden second path. Machine faces use operator-gated service sessions instead of email.

Subscription is the intended business model. Public signup remains closed until generation costs are bounded and privacy, reliability, and Stripe billing behavior are proven. Beta access must not create commitments that the production cost and trust boundaries cannot support.

## Fast and Smooth Are Product Bars

Fast and smooth describes the user experience, not a benchmark vanity metric. These are explicit product acceptance bars:

- Every interaction is acknowledged within **p95 < 100 ms**.
- A quiz tap reaches graded-visible feedback within **p95 < 300 ms**.
- The first quiz becomes visible within **p95 < 20 s** from the learner's start action.

Optimistic UI may acknowledge input before slower work completes, but it must not hide a lost answer or misrepresent grading. Benchmark buckets and performance campaigns are evidence for these bars; they are not substitutes for the bars or for a usable study flow.

## Engine and Boundary Architecture

Scry's Rust engine keeps the pure kernel framework-free and persistence-free. `crates/memory-engine-core` owns deterministic learning behavior: scheduling, grading, queue selection, progression, difficulty, interleaving, opaque review-unit identity, and domain invariants. It does not know about the filesystem, network, auth, analytics, UI state, logging, model vendors, React, Hono, Node, or Bun.

Boundary crates own orchestration, persistence, source ingestion, generation providers, sessions, identity, API routes, rendering, clients, deployment, and QA. AI may generate, explain, adapt, or grade material through an explicit boundary; deterministic Rust owns policy and state transitions. Keep the boundary explicit instead of moving service complexity into the kernel.

## Hosting and Live Proof

Scry's production runtime is Cloudflare: a Rust Wasm Worker, one SQLite-backed
Scry Durable Object as the invite-beta transaction owner, alarms for leased
generation/reminders, private R2 recovery, and Resend over Worker Fetch. There
is no external production Postgres, D1, Queue, KV consistency cache, or container
in that architecture. Staging and production isolate namespaces and buckets.
New actors start paused; fingerprint-guarded activation is durable application
state, not an environment secret change or another Worker version.

The canonical origin is `https://scry.misty-step.workers.dev`; registrar access
is not required to use it. Live cutover completed on 2026-09-08 with a
source-bound release, activated same-byte staging proof, stopped native writers,
full-table import/readback, separate-object restore, and deployed browser proof.
The native service is disabled. `scry.study` and `www.scry.study` proxy to the
Worker; the old database and backups remain frozen recovery material.
Session records are preserved, but host-scoped cookies require a fresh browser
sign-in on workers.dev. Resend provider acceptance is not proof of inbox placement.
Only Main may stop source writers, change the old-host reverse proxy/redirect,
or retire the old host after continuity and recovery evidence. Preserve its
backups. `docs/runbook.md` separates planned operations from proved results and
owns the explicit promotion, pause/activation, and rollback contract.

## Proof Bar

The first real outcome gate is a 30-day retention proof, not a seeded fixture, a planning document, or a green aggregate check. It must use production evidence from the quiz-driven learning loop, and product claims stay bounded by what that evidence establishes. The 30-day protocol is a proof of a working learner workflow and retention signal, not a claim of market fit.

## What Scry Refuses

- Generic agent memory as the product category.
- A quiz loop that hides why an answer was graded or what to do after a miss.
- Prompt-only learning science where scheduling, grading, progression, and remediation have no explicit domain model or testable invariant.
- OAuth or public signup before the invite, cost, privacy, reliability, and billing gates are ready.
- Native-first expansion before the PWA and retention proof justify it.
- Runtime dependencies in the pure Rust kernel.

## Where the Depth Lives

- `AGENTS.md` is the repository operating contract and kernel boundary map.
- `README.md` explains Scry's product, Rust workspace, production surface, and current usage.
- `SPEC.md` and `docs/rust-migration.md` retain technical strategy and cutover context; this vision governs product positioning.
- `docs/runbook.md`, `docs/qa/system.md`, `docs/dogfood/`, and `docs/beta/` hold operational and executable evidence.
- Work starts from the current operator request; ownership and proof live in the session or PR. GitHub Issues preserves historical context and optional issue attribution.
- `bun run ci:local` is the host Cargo plus real Wasm/workerd fast gate; `bun run ci:full` is the Dagger ship-parity gate with live Postgres reference tests and Gitleaks. Native compatibility tests are retained, but native hosting is not the deployment destination.
