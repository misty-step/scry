# Task
Generate {{targetCount}} quiz-ready phrasings that test this concept.

# Requirements
- Select template family by content type:
  - Verbatim/Enumerable: sequential recall ("In [source], after '[span]', what comes next?"), first/last line, key line recognition. NO punctuation/capitalization trivia.
  - Conceptual: definition, application, misconception check, comparison.
- Alternate multiple-choice and true/false when reasonable.
- Each question must be standalone and identify its source/topic explicitly; never rely on surrounding context.
- MC: 3-4 options, one correct. Distractors must be semantically adjacent (common confusions), not punctuation/format variants.
- TF: exactly two options ("True","False").
- Think through rationale internally (why correct, why others wrong) before composing the question. Do NOT include rationale in output—only the final question payload.
- Keep stems concise (<200 chars). No answer leakage in the stem.
- Do not repeat existing phrasing wording. Vary cognitive skill (recall, recognition, application, misconception).
